		<h3 class="">The Notebook</h3>
<p>At a modern-day nursing home, an elderly man, Duke (James Garner), reads a romantic story from his notebook to a fellow patient Allie. Both Duke and Allie live in a nursing home.
In 1940, Seabrook Island, South Carolina, poor lumber mill worker Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) sees 17-year-old heiress Allison "Allie" Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) at a carnival. He pursues her, coerces her into dating him. Noah approaches Allie to ask for a dance, which she refuses. Allie goes on the Ferris wheel with a friend, and Noah jumps on the wheel and sits in the same carriage as Allie. Noah asks Allie out for a date, but she refuses again. Noah threatens to jump off the wheel unless Allie agrees to the date. Allie agrees to go out on a date with Noah, to stop him from jumping off.<br><br>

Later, Allie refuses to honor her promise of a date. Noah uses his friend Fin and his girlfriend Sara (Heather Wahlquist) to lure Allie for a movie night and Noah reaches there with Fin. Noah later walks Allie home. Allie reveals that she had not seen a movie in ages, as she doesn't have much time. Her schedule is decided by her parents, and she has tutors and activities almost all day.

Noah goads Allie by insinuating that she is not free to do as she pleases. They share a dance in the middle of the street. Noah and Allie start a romance. They started spending every waking hour together and fall in love with each other. They argued a lot, and rarely agreed on anything, but they also had a lot of fun. Allie learned swimming and how to drive a truck, with Noah. Despite their differences they were crazy about each other.<br><br>

When Allie meets Noah's father Frank Calhoun (Sam Shepard), he immediately likes her. Frank is warm, inviting and free of any prejudice. However, when Noah meets her parents, they disapprove. Noah is made to admit that he makes 40 cents an hour at his job at the lumberyard. They believe that Noah has too much spirit for Allie, who comes from a different background and circumstances.

Noah takes Allie to an abandoned house at Windsor...</p>
