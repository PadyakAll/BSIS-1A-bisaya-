	<div class="column1">
	<div class="div1"><img src="./main1.webp" alt="MC"><p><b>Noah Calhoun</b> is the main protagonist of the 2004 film, The notebook. He's the boyfriend and later husband of 17 year-old Allie Hamilton. At a summer carnival in 1940, Noah saw Allie. He fell in love with the young lady and wanted to go on a date with her.</p></div>

	<div class="div2"><p>We never find out what occurred with Noah's mother, but it is presumed she either passed away or abandoned her husband to rear Noah by himself. Noah was consistently near Allie and his dad. As a kid, he had trouble with language, which his father assisted him in overcoming by reading Whitman poems. At a certain period in his life, he encountered Phin, probably at school, and they formed a close friendship. The pair would later join forces in World War II. <br><br> In the summer of 1940, he encountered Allie, a wealthy girl vacationing with her family. They fell in love and formed a nice couple (not so nice, but alright). They spent time together daily, despite Allie's severe demeanor. They ended their relationship, though, following an argument between Allie and her parents, who disrespected Noah. Allie needed to depart from town as summer was nearing its close and she had to head to New York. Additionally, World War II had just begun, and Noah was required to depart as well. During the conflict, Phin passed away in the embrace of his closest companion (Noah). <br><br>Noah penned letters to Allie daily for an entire year. Allie's mother concealed them, deceiving Allie into believing that Noah had moved on with his life. During World War II, Allie served as a volunteer at a hospital, where she cared for soldiers. There she encountered Lon, a soldier who invited her on a date. Noah came back to his hometown, to his dad. After his passing, he sold his house and constructed the home Allie desired (white with blue windows). She came back to him initially as a friend, but eventually expressed her emotions. Lon acknowledged Allie's emotions and set her free. Years later, Noah would pass away beside Allie, the love of his life, in a hospital.</p></div>

			<p popover id="div1"><b>Allie Calson</b><br>Allie Nelson, the secondary protagonist and narrator of the novel, is a sensitive and romantic young woman who finds herself at a crossroads between passion and logic as she questions her choices and revisits her past love with Noah Calhoun in the weeks before her wedding to Lon Hammond, Jr. The narrative switches between Noah and Allie’s perspectives for much of the book, allowing the reader insights into Allie’s thoughts and feelings as she reconnects with Noah, the country boy with whom she had an unforgettable, passionate, and deeply romantic summer fling back in 1932...

			<p popover id="div2"><b>Lon Hammond Jr.</b><br>
				Lon Hammond, Jr. is Allie’s fiancé; he’s an intelligent and hardworking lawyer who comes from a wealthy, powerful family who made their money in the cotton industry long ago. Allie describes Lon as caring, gentlemanly, hardworking, and steady—yet as she reconnects with Noah 14 years after their summer fling, she finds herself comparing Lon to Noah in more nuanced ways. Lon has never understood Allie’s ambitions as an artist—when she’s showed him her paintings in the past, he’s reacted with indifference or confusion. Lon is a hardworking provider, but his hours are so long and his cases so demanding that he and Allie rarely talk deeply about their lives, memories, or opinions—Lon is barely even home for dinner once a week.

			<p popover id="div3"><b>Anne Nelson</b><br>
				Anne Nelson is Allie’s strait-laced mother. Anne disapproves of Allie and Noah’s summer fling in 1932, believing that Noah is “too poor” to be a suitable match for her daughter. As a result of her fear about Allie and Noah becoming serious, Anne confiscates the many letters Noah sends to Allie after the Nelson family departs New Bern at the end of the summer, keeping them from Allie for 14 years. When Anne learns that Allie has traveled to New Bern under the guise of antiquing to reconnect with Noah, Anne follows Allie out to the coast to deliver the letters to her and to warn her that Lon, too, has figured out what Allie is up to and is on his way. Though Anne defends her actions 14 years ago, in giving the letters to Allie, she also concedes that Allie must be in charge of her own fate. She encourages Allie to follow her heart as she makes a decision between Lon and Noah. Although Anne is buttoned-up and slightly cold, she’s perhaps a secret romantic at heart; Allie believes that her mother ultimately wants her to choose love over logic and emotional fulfillment over material wealth.<input type="button" popovertarget="div3" value='x'></p>
